## Coloring #
A glsl color is defined as a vec4 variable of rgba float normalized values, i.e., each in [0.0, 1.0].



## Color blending #
Blending two colors is implemented by doing a component-wise multiplication between them:

the resulted color can be further modulated by multiplying it by a given brightness value in [0.0, 1.0].
